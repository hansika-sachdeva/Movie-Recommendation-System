# Movie Recommendation System
## Overview
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on various criteria such as plot/summary, actors, and directors. Cosine similarity metric is used to calculate similarities among the movies in the database. I have used Streamlit to create an interactive webpage where user enters the title of the movie they like and the system displays the top 5 recommendations based on the calculated cosine similarities.
